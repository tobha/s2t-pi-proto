This app is a "fork and merge" of IBM Watson Personality Insights and IBM Watson Speech to Text. The purpose of the app is to listen to a person speaking and provide a personality profile of the speaker.
The app is currently under development and in non-functioning prototype stage.

I've created a short video describing the problem I'm encountering:
